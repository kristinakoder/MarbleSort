## MarbleSort

Made to use while listening to podcasts or audiobooks on my commute.

Very easy to make. Used Godot, which is a fun game engine, but when coding in C# it can't be published to web, and building for android was experimental (worked eventually though). I have several ideas I'd like to implement, but as I am also curious to see if it will be less demanding to run (it really drains my phone) when developed in Unity, I've made a [new version](https://github.com/kristinakoder/Marbles) instead.
